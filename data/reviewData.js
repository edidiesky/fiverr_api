        description: "Peter was very easy work with on creating my new website. He was very professional and always answered my queries in a timely manner. The website is absolutely amazing! Aesthetics, presentation and ease of navigation top notch. From a design point of view, it exceeded anything I could dream up in my own mind. A few tweaks (nothing major) were made and this was carried out by Peter with no problem whatsoever. This is the first time i've had a website built and the experience was a really good one and i am so glad I chose Peter as the designer. Highly recommended"
